# Algorithms and Computational Complexity â€“ C++ Projects

This repository contains two object-oriented C++ applications developed as part of the **Algorithms and Computational Complexity** course at WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology.  
Each project focuses on the implementation, testing, and experimental evaluation of fundamental algorithms.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. AIZO_Sorting
An application implementing and benchmarking classic **sorting algorithms**:
- Insertion Sort
- QuickSort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort

The program automatically generates a new random dataset for each run.  
It was designed for experimental analysis of algorithm efficiency under different input sizes and characteristics.

### 2. AIZO_Graphs
An application for studying the performance of **graph algorithms** depending on graph size and representation (adjacency matrix vs adjacency list).  
Implemented algorithms include:
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Primâ€™s algorithm, Kruskalâ€™s algorithm  
- **Shortest Path**: Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm  

Features:
- Random graph generation with configurable number of vertices and density  
- Graph loading from file (text-based edge list format)  
- Execution of algorithms on both adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations  
- Measurement of execution times for experimental evaluation  
- Console-based menu for selecting problems and operations
